Machine learning project that train and develop a Air Quality Forecasting Service using Feature Store <https://app.hopsworks.ai> and the architecture of Feature/Training/Inference Pipelines. The project is designed to be a comprehensive example of how to build a machine learning system that can be used in production. It includes all the necessary components, from data extraction and cleaning to model training and deployment.

Project reference from the book [Building Machine Learning Systems with a feature store: batch, real-time, and LLMs - Jim Dowling(2025)](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/building-machine-learning/9781098165222/)

This project project used the template from [@JoseRZapata]'s [data science project template] which have all the necessary tools for experiment, development, testing, and deployment data science and machine learning From notebooks to production.
